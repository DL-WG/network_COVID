
one need to generate dynamic multilayer networks using construction_scale_free.py and save the generated graph in the network repo before 
simulating the disease propagation

construction_scale_free.py: simulationg dynamic scale-free multilayer networks by provind the number of nodes,the density 
and the number of time steps.

draw_multilayer.py: presenting the simulated dynamical multilayer networks 

multilayer_diffusion.py: simulating the disease propagation in the multilayer network with or without DA corrections
